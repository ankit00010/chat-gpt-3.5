This is a simple chatbot web application powered by the OpenAI API. Similar to the popular chatbot ChatGPT, it allows users to input text, sends the request to OpenAI, and displays the relevant response in the chat area. The left-hand sidebar stores all previous chats for easy reference.

## How it works

1. **User Input**: Enter your text in the input area.
2. **OpenAI API**: The request is sent to the OpenAI API for generating a chatbot response.
3. **Chat Display**: The relevant response is displayed in the chat area.
4. **Chat History**: All previous chats are stored in the left-hand sidebar for your reference.
